# The-Angular-Django-Messenger

This is a light-weight chatting application built on a Django REST API Framework Backend, Angular Frontend and a SOCKET.IO WebSocket server.


## Working

This creates an **Angular** front-end server in ***localhost:4200***(the one which the users access). The **Django** backend gets hosted on ***localhost:8000***(the one which serves the **requests**  of ***localhost:4200***) and finally the **WebSocket** server is hosted on ***localhost:3000*** and provides users access to real-time communication and secure chat-rooms !
